# SSE Dissertation Template

Before you do anything else, make sure you can build the template. You need:

* A recent version of LaTeX, [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) for Mac or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) for Windows.
* Requires Garamondx, a font that is not included with these builds. Can be downloaded and installed following [these instructions](https://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/).
